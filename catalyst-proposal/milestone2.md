# Milestone 2 Report

Hey there and happy day to you Milestone Reviewers and anyone else following the progress of this proposal.

Here we are submitting the report of the successful completion of Milestone 2 of this proposal.

The acceptance criteria had been stated as:

- Public link listing confirmed workshop participants: Considering the fact that this event is for Ambassadors, the confirmation list will be for Ambassadors who have confirmed that they wish to attend.
- Venue confirmation: Public url's to the payment and booking confirmations of the workshop venue
- Public link to the workshop agenda: Public url to the Workshop agenda, accessible via the workshop website.

And here the deliverables and respective evidence of the Milestone completion:

### Public list confirming workshop participants:
We added a page on the event website where we track the signed up and confirmed attendees with links to their respective X/Twitter accounts:
- https://ambassador-workshop.netlify.app/attendees/ 

Since we still have a healthy time to go until the event, we will keep the signup open to allow ambassadors to further sign up.
(especially wanted to keep it open since some Ambassadors do have to wait for e.g visa-approvals or other factors which determine their ability to join)

### Venue Confirmation:
The venue has been booked and confirmed, we added the respective PDF files which confirm the reservation in this publicly accessible folder:

### Public Link to the workshop agenda:
The /agenda page gives an overview on the defined agenda of the workshop and its sessions.
- https://ambassador-workshop.netlify.app/agenda/ 

While Day2 of the event is reserved for Ambassadors to sign up and host Sessions, Day3 will provide two slots to the Cardano Foundation and one slot for locals. Quite glad to have a well diverse agenda & topics gathered so far. A bit of everything for everyone. And we still expect Ambassadors to host spontaneous ad-hoc sessions as the days go by, so ye, pretty sure we won't get bored ^^

And that's it 🙂
Ambassadors sign up keep coming in (will update the website accordingly to track new entries), sessions are being signed up from both sides, Ambassadors and the Cardano Foundation while we continue to plan out further details and event support such as documents for visa applications by Ambassadors, figure how to film/record stuff etc. And for sure, online meetings with the venue owners who became apparently quite interested about Cardano, so onboarding there is in full process too. ^^

Hope all provided information satisfies the Reviewers expectations.
